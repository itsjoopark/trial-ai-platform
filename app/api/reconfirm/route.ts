   POST /api/reconfirm  —  re-judge open criteria after the patient adds info

   When a patient answers a "confirm" to-do (or when that new fact is re-checked
   against another trial's open items), we re-run the SAME per-criterion judgment
   over just the criteria in question — not the whole trial. This keeps the click
   cheap while preserving the trust invariants:

   - Same verdict rules as /api/match (imported, never re-stated).
   - "confirm" stays "confirm" when the added info still isn't enough — the model
     is told explicitly not to guess a pass or a fail into existence.
   - The overall trial status is re-derived on the client from the returned
     verdicts using the shared deriveStatus() — never a model self-report.

You are given the patient's structured profile (which already includes any info they just added, tagged as told-by-you) and a short list of criteria that were previously open ("confirm") or that this new info might bear on. Re-judge EACH criterion, in order.

${VERDICT_RULES}

Re-judging discipline:
- Only move a criterion off "confirm" when the information now genuinely decides it. If it is still unknown, keep it "confirm" — a coordinator to-do is the honest answer, not a guess.
- Judge each criterion independently and return them in the SAME order given. Do not add, drop, merge, or reorder criteria.
- In the evidence, cite the patient's added info in plain words (e.g. "You confirmed these tests were ordered in routine care").`;
