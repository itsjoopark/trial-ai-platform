/* ============================================================================
   Demo fixture — deterministic match result for the "Margaret" sample patient.

   Live matching (fail-closed + confirm-is-first-class) rarely yields a clean
   "eligible" from a terse note, which makes the demo unreliable. When the sample
   patient is used (client sends `demo: "margaret"` to /api/match), we return
   this curated, instant, always-identical result instead of calling the model.
   Every other input still runs the real live pipeline.

   The trials are REAL ClinicalTrials.gov studies in Margaret's exact space
   (HR+/HER2-, PIK3CA-mutant, HER2-low, post-CDK4/6) so the deep links resolve;
   the ledgers are hand-authored to demonstrate the product: 3 eligible, 1
   uncertain (a genuine data gap → "confirm"), 1 ruled-out (fail-closed).
   Illustrative for the demo persona only — not a live eligibility determination.
